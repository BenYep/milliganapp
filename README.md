# milliganapp
Unity 3D powered app for IOS and Android developed for Milligan College (Code only) - For Educational Uses

***No longer supported - Now used for educational purposes***

Note: Unity 5 uses .NET version 2.0

All scripts written by me are located in the "Scripts" directory.
This project is dependent on the SpriteMask, a Unity3D library sold by PoL231 on the Unity Asset Store.
Primary C# script is Main.cs in /Scripts/Mains

The unity_lesson directory contains a guide that is meant to introduce aspiring Unity developers to the idiosyncrasies of Unity 2D development.
